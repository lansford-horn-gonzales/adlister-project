# adlister-project

Hello, and welcome to our Adlister Project! 

We are Sam, Emily, and Ann. We study Full Stack Web Development at Codeup, San Antonio. Codeup is a 20-week career accelorator that has challenged us with learning various programming languages and methodologies. 

For this project, we implemented:
Java
mySQL
Servlets
JSP

Adlister is quite like a Craigslist where users can post items for others to view. We used CRUD functionalities for both users and ads, and the capability to use a search bar to search through the mySQL database of ads.

We thank you for visiting our github project page, feel free to check out our code!
