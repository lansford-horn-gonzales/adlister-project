# adlister-project

Hello, and welcome to our Adlister Project! We are Sam, Emily, and Ann. We study Full Stack Web Development at Codeup,
San Antonio. Codeup is a 22-week career accelorator that has challenged us with learning various programming languages
and methodologies.

The original project was to create a platform similar to Craigslist where users could create, edit, and delete ads to
share with the community. Although, it took a creative twist, as Emily is an artist and ui/ux designer. We implemented
the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT's) into our project to create a platform where artists can log in and post their
NFT's for sale.

For this project, we used the following technologies:
Java programming on IntelliJ Maven mySQL MVC HTML, custom CSS, and Bootstrap

We set CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities for both users and NFT's on our mySQL database, and the
capability to use a search bar to search through the mySQL database of ads/NFT's.

We thank you for visiting our github project page, feel free to check out our code!

Concept Storyline:

Welcome to the lands of Ether where wild creatures roam in a land of uncharted territory. Amongst the magical beasts of
Ether, one will encounter the collection of CryptoHorns designed and curated by artist Emily Horn. Each CryptoHorn is
specifically mined just for you, and can be verified by EtherScan, making these Non-Fungible Tokens unique and destined
to increase in value as the price of Etherium rises during these exciting times of adventurous pursuits in decentralized
finance. Letâ€™s face it, the journey into cryptocurrency can be a little scary. Why face it alone, if you can have your
very own CryptoHorn friend with you on your journey. Make CryptoHorns by Emily Horn a part of your wallet today!
